Data Structures & Algorithms style coding interviews are a relatively controversial topic among the SWE community. Many I have talked to believe that your DS&A mastery says relatively little about your software development aptitudes, and further that DS&A's are near useless when it comes to your actual SWE job. 

As an inexperienced student and developer myself who has only gone through a handful of coding interviews, I do not have the most credible opinion. But as far as I can tell, DS&A mastery has the *intention* of finding out how well a candidate can think in an abstract manner. After all, DS&A are abstract ideas just like code before it blossoms into an actual usable product. Interviewers want to know that you can take an intangible idea and implement it, describe its use cases, narrate its strong and weakpoints, and how to use it. When would you ever use MergeSort? Exactly, when would you?
